# GIT Tutorial

Source code: [vnk8071/git_tutorial](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/tree/main/examples/git_tutorial)

## Overview
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. It is essential for the integrity of the project and the people working on it.

And last but not least, 80% of the time we're just going to use about 20% of the available git commands.

## Configuration
```git
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email "email"
```

**Details** in [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and [Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/)

## Basic flow
```git
git clone <url>.git
git checkout -b <branch_name>
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin <branch_name>
```

Example:
Follow the instructions in `flow.py`:
![basic_flow](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_flow.png)

Check remote branches:
![basic_flow_push_origin](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_flow_push_origin.png)

## Common workflow patterns
### Single branch workflow
- Use a single branch for all changes.
- Use tags to mark important commits.
![single_branch](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/single_branch.png)

| # | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | It is simple. | It is not recommended to use in remote branches. |
| 2 | It is easy to resolve conflicts. | It is not recommended to use in large projects. |
| 3 | It is easy to revert a commit. | It is not recommended to use in colaborating with others. |

### Branch based development workflow
- The master/main is never committed to directly.
- New features are developed in separate branches, and then if colaborating with others, merged could be approved by pull request into the master/main branch.

| # | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | It is easy to revert a commit. | It is harder to resolve conflicts. |
| 2 | It is easy to review changes. | It is not recommended to use in local branches. |
| 3 | It is easy to collaborate with others. | Need dedicated time to review changes. |


## Back in time
### Revert
```git
git log
git revert <commit_hash>
git commit -m "[REVERT] <commit_hash>"
git push origin <branch_name>
```

Example:
Follow the instructions in `revert.py`:
![revert_log](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/revert_log.png)

We want to revert the commit `0fcd910e9488b06d2206ff59c556e92a03a6f4ca`:
```git
git revert 0fcd910e9488b06d2206ff59c556e92a03a6f4ca
git commit -m "[REVERT] 0fcd910e9488b06d2206ff59c556e92a03a6f4ca"
```

Result:
```
[git-flow 7e41a10] Revert "UPDATE github link into doc projects"
 7 files changed, 14 deletions(-)
```
![after_revert_log](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/after_revert_log.png)

We can see that the commit `0fcd910e9488b06d2206ff59c556e92a03a6f4ca` is reverted.

### Reset
```git
git log
git reset --hard <commit_hash>
git commit -m "[RESET] <commit_hash>"
git push origin <branch_name>
```
![after_revert_log](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/after_revert_log.png)

We can see that the commit `0fcd910e9488b06d2206ff59c556e92a03a6f4ca` is reset.


## Branches
### Create a branch
```git
git checkout -b <branch_name>
git push origin <branch_name>
```

Example:
Follow the instructions in `branch.py`:
```git
git checkout -b git-flow
```
![basic_branch](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_branch.png)

```git
git push origin git-flow
```

![basic_branch_push_origin](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_branch_push_origin.png)

### Delete a branch
```git
git branch -d <branch_name>
git push origin --delete <branch_name>
```

## Merge
```git
git checkout <branch_target>
git merge <branch_name>
git push origin <branch_target>
```
![basic_merge](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_merge.png)

Follow the instructions in `merge.py`:
Ìf merge conflict, we need to resolve it first.

```git
git checkout main
git merge git-flow
```

Example:
```git
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the first line of the main branch.
=======
This is the first line of the git-flow branch.
>>>>>>> git-flow
```
![basic_resolve_conflict](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_resolve_conflict.png)

Then accept the changes could be current | incoming | both and commit:
```git
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve conflict"
git push origin main
```

## Check changes
```git
git status
git log
git diff <commit_hash_1> <commit_hash_2>
git diff <branch_name_1> <branch_name_2>
```

## Remote
![remote_git](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/remote_git.png)

Before we can push to a team repository, we need to pull and resolve conflicts first.
```git
git pull
```

Then we can push to the team repository.
```git
git push origin <branch_name>
```

## Stash
Using `git stash` to save changes in a dirty working directory and then pull latest changes from remote repository.
```git
git stash save
git pull
```

Then we can apply stashed changes to working directory.
```git
git stash pop

or

git stash apply
```

Example:
```git
git checkout main
git pull
```

Then raise a bug and fix it.
```git
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by pull:
    README.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you pull.
Aborting
```

In this case, we can stash changes and pull latest changes from remote repository.
```git
git stash save
git pull
```

Then we can apply stashed changes to working directory.
```git

## Rebase
Similar to merge, but rebase reapply commits on top of another base tip.
```git
git rebase <branch_name>
```

Example:
It squashes all commits of <branch_name> into one commit and reapply on top of <branch_target>.

![basic_rebase](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_rebase.png)

Then it rewrites the history of <branch_target> and we need to force push to the remote repository.

![basic_rebase_master](https://github.com/vnk8071/machine-learning-in-production/raw/main/examples/git_tutorial/images/basic_rebase_master.png)

| # | Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | It keeps the history clean. | It is harder to resolve conflicts. |
| 2 | It is easier to revert a commit. | It loses the context of the commits. |
| 3 | Using in local branches. | It is not recommended to use in remote branches. |

## Squash
Using squash to combine multiple commits into one commit.
```git
git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits>
```

**Note**: Not recommended to use in remote branches when colaborating with others.

## Less used commands
| # | Command | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `git rename <old_name> <new_name>` | Rename a file |
| 2 | `git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>` | Rename a remote |
| 3 | `git restore --staged <file_name>` | Unstage a file |


## Use cases
### Git merge vs rebase
```
git merge feature main
```
This creates a new “merge commit” in the feature branch that ties together the histories of both branches, giving you a branch structure that looks like this:

![git_merge_feature](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:4639eeb8-e417-434a-a3f8-a972277fc66a/02%20Merging%20main%20into%20the%20feature%20branh.svg?cdnVersion=1240)

```git
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

This moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the main branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in main. But, instead of using a merge commit, rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.

![git_rebase_feature](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:3bafddf5-fd55-4320-9310-3d28f4fca3af/03%20Rebasing%20the%20feature%20branch%20into%20main.svg?cdnVersion=1240)

or we can interactive rebase:
```git
git checkout feature
git rebase -i main
```

```
pick 33d5b7a Message for commit #1
fixup 9480b3d Message for commit #2
pick 5c67e61 Message for commit #3
```
![git_rebase_feature_interactive](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a712e238-6cb9-4c8c-8ef7-1975dca49be3/04%20Squashing%20a%20commit%20with%20an%20interactive%20rebase.svg?cdnVersion=1240)

Finally, the feature branch has all of the commits from main and a nice, clean history:
```git
git checkout feature
git rebase -i main
git checkout main
git merge feature
```
![git_merge_feature_main](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:412813ee-381f-42f6-8b43-79760d2da0dc/08-10%20Integrating%20a%20feature%20into%20master%20with%20and%20without%20a%20rebase.svg?cdnVersion=1240)

### Git reset vs revert
```git
git checkout hotfix
git reset HEAD~2
```
The two commits that were on the end of hotfix are now dangling, or orphaned commits. This means they will be deleted the next time Git performs a garbage collection. In other words, you’re saying that you want to throw away these commits. This can be visualized as the following:
![git_reset_hotfix](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:e8a43261-2460-4783-9731-1197dc8959ab/03-04%20Reset%20a%20specific%20commit.png?cdnVersion=1240)

```git
git checkout hotfix
git revert HEAD~2
```
Reverting undoes a commit by creating a new commit. This is a safe way to undo changes, as it has no chance of re-writing the commit history.
This can be visualized as the following:

![git_revert_hotfix](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:f02c67ca-d7b8-47f8-98f8-e0017dc9f7c5/08-09%20Undo%20public%20commits.svg?cdnVersion=1240)

## Git hooks
Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. Git hooks are a built-in feature - no need to download anything. Git hooks are run locally.

Install `pre-commit`:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
brew install pre-commit
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
```

Then run `pre-commit install` to install the git hook scripts into `.git/hooks/`:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Pre-commit hook
Add the following to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-case-conflict
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: requirements-txt-fixer
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-autopep8
    rev: 'v2.0.2'
    hooks:
      - id: autopep8
        args: [--in-place, --aggressive, --aggressive, --recursive]
```

Auto enable pre-commit hook:
```bash
$ git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
$ pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
```

When we commit, the pre-commit hook will run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ADD latest git tutorial and ADD edit page"
```
